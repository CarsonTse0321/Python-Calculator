# Python-Calculator
This is my first python project. I am still learning and hope to be better ^_^

I try to make it like a exam calculator that being widely used by HKDSE candidates

In this calculator, you can use the basic calculation tools by using the symbol like + - * /

Besides, you can also use this calculator to solve quadratic equation with one unknown by typing 01; find the area of a triangle with 3 given sides by heron's formula 02 ; find the length of the oppo. side by cos formula 03.
